# PR01 Microsoft employees should be linked

This rule detects users who appear to be Microsoft users (e.g. company or email
field contains "Microsoft") but aren't linked. Linking ensures that:

1. We know which Microsoft user account is linked to which GitHub account
2. We can automatically remove users when they leave the company

The linking is described in the [documentation] and can be done by individuals
by visiting:
