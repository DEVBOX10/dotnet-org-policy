# PR14 Repo ownership must be explicit

Repos need to indicate whether they are owned by Microsoft. That's because we
have some policies that are specific to Microsoft repos. This policy ensures
that repos aren't treated as non-owned by Microsoft by default.

*Note: Some orgs (such as ASP.NET) are assumed to be entirely owned by
Microsoft. This rule only applies to orgs where some repos are owned by
Microsoft and some are owned by the community.*

* **Owned by Microsoft**. Assign the [microsoft] team with `read` permissions.
* **Not owned by Microsoft**. Assign the [non-microsoft] team with `read`
  permissions.
