# PR25 Microsoft-owned private repos should not grant access via any non-Microsoft owned teams

Repos shouldn't give any access to non-Microsoft owned teams. The team should
either be removed from the repo or the team should be owned by Microsoft (which
in turn will mean it can't contain any non-Microsoft users).

In the rare case where giving non-Microsoft users access is intentional, a
justification needs to be provided in the opened policy violation issue, marked
as overridden, and closed.
