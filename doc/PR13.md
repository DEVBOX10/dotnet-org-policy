# PR13 Collaborator access is superfluous

Maintaining collaborators on GitHub can be tedious. To keep things tidy, we
don't want redundant permissions. For example, organization owners and users
that have an equal to higher permission via a team shouldn't be added as
collaborators.

In those cases, you should remove the collaborator access.
