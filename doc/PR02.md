# PR02 Microsoft-owned repo should only grant 'pull' to externals

Microsoft-owned repos should only grant non-Microsoft users with `pull`
permissions.

* If this is a Microsoft user, they need to [link] their account.
* If this isn't a Microsoft user, their permission needs to be changed to
  `pull`.
