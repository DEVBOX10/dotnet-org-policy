# PR02 Microsoft-owned repo should at most grant 'triage' to externals

Microsoft-owned repos should at most grant non-Microsoft users with `triage`
permissions.

* If this is a Microsoft user, they need to [link] their account.
* If this isn't a Microsoft user, their permission needs to be changed to
  `triage`.
