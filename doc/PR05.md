# PR05 Marker team should only grant 'read' access

Marker teams are only used to indicate ownership. It should only ever grant
`read` permissions. Examples of marker teams are:

* [microsoft](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/teams/microsoft)
* [microsoft-bots](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/teams/microsoft-bots)
* [bots](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/teams/bots)

Change the permissions for the marker team in the repo to `read`.
